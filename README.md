## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The only requirement for this project is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine. 

### Troubleshooting
If you see an error like "command not found": This means Node.js is not installed or the system's PATH variable is not set correctly.

If you need to install Node.js: You can download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en). Choose the version that matches your operating system.

### Verify nodejs and npm are installed

```shell
node -v
```
>This command will display the installed version of Node.js if it is installed. For example, it might return something like v16.13.0.

```shell
node -v
```
>This will display the installed version of npm if it is present.
